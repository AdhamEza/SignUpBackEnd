# This project is a BACKEND side of registeration

In this project I actually developed my first backend side long time ago using authorization, developing it

using NODE JS & MONGO DB and checking it with the POSTMAN application, I commited it for a memory even though

I have newer and better authorization projects that I will commit soon.
